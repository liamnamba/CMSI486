1.1 – Project description, database engine used, potential users, maybe some other stuff
For our project, we will be creating an athletic team database using MySQL. This will keep track of all players on the Loyola Marymount University Women's Soccer team and their statistics. The potential users of this database are coaches or athletic departments who want to keep track and seek out statistics for their players. 

1.2 – Data description, generally what type of data will be stored
The data stored will be: Player names, number, class year, hometown, goals scored, assists, minutes played, cards received, games started, games played, games won, games lost, and games tied. This data will be stored in three tables: a player table, a games table, and a statistics table. We will potentially come up with more data points as the project progresses.

1.3 – At least five examples of the type of data your database will provide to the user


1.4 – A preliminary idea of the schema of the database including table descriptions and potential columns
The database will include three tables. A player table which will have columns player name, number, class year, and hometown with number being the primary key. Second there will be a game table with columns games started, games played, games won, games lost, and games tied. Lastly will be the statistics table with goals scored, assists, minuted played, and cards received.
