This is VERY good work.  You have addessed all of the required topics.

What will be the primary key for each of the tables in your ERD?  There is no
indication...  For example, since this is only for the LMU team, the player number
is probably good enough.  However, if you were to expand it to include other teams
you might have conflicts when two teams both have a player number 23.

For the Statistics and Games tables, are you planning a surrogate key?


you have 10% out of 10% which is 100% on this deliverable for an A-plus
