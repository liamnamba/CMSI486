You did a very nice job with this!  The ERD is very clean.  You have only
listed one primary key, so the other two entities should show theirs, too.

The data dictionary is a bit unconventional in your presentation, but that's
not a bad thing.  I like stepping outside the box!


Overall, VERY NICE WORK!

you have 10% out of 10% which is 100% on this deliverable for an A-plus
