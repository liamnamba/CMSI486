**ValuJet Write Up**


**Part One:**
	

The story of ValuJet flight 592 begins in Miami. The plane took off and within ten minutes, smoke began to fill the cabin and the pilots began to lose control over their electrical instruments. A flight attendant came in and told the pilots that there was a fire in the passenger cabin. The flight controls and electrical systems failed due to the damage from the fire. Trying to turn the plane back to Miami to land the plane was seen crashing into a marsh-like area. People watching said that the plan was at a near vertical angle. It was later discovered that the fire was started below the passenger cabin in the cargo compartment.
	
	
 The cargo compartment was designed to stop fires by sealing off oxygen, so that any inferno would quickly suffocate. In fact, cargo compartments like these were not even equipped with smoke detectors. However, this plane was carrying expired chemical oxygen generators. These generators use a chemical reaction to generate oxygen incase the plane loses cabin pressure. Also, this chemical reaction causes a lot of heat when active. The canisters were packed in boxes by SabreTech, a maintenance contractor, and mislabeled. Also, the firing pins of these generators where duct taped down and wrapped around the canisters, rather than being covered by prescribed plastic safeties. SabreTech told workers that the boxes contained ‘empty oxy canisters’. The ValuJet workers thought they were simply empty containers, not live chemical-reacting oxygen generators. 
As it was reported, the plane experienced a jolt during taxiing. This set off one of the oxygen canisters. It filled up the cargo compartment with oxygen while simultaneously increasing in temperature. Once the plane was in the air, the canister heated up the nearby box to 500 degrees celsius and started a fire. The oxygen produced by the generator was enough to fuel the fire as it grew, despite the air-tight design of the cargo. The fire destroyed control cables which ran near the cargo which is why the pilots lost control over the plane. Had the cargo compartment had a smoke detector, the flight crew could have used fire suppression systems before it interrupted the pilot’s controls, buying the pilots time to land the plane safely.


**Part Two:**


When looking at the disaster of ValuJet’s flight 592 through the lens of software, there are many parallels one could make. The first that comes to mind is one of documentation. Part of the reason the ValuJet disaster occurred was that the oxygen canisters were not documented accurately, causing later workers to have skewed information. If the SabreTech workers had labeled the boxes correctly, workers wouldn't have assumed that they contained simple oxygen canisters. They could have taken the correct precautions to make sure that they were never put in the cargo of the flight. Similarly, if a piece of important code is not documented correctly, it could give another software engineer incomplete or inaccurate information about the code. If they continue the project based off of the assumption of this inaccurate information, projects could have major issues. If this software deals with finances or aerospace, the consequences could be major.
	
	
Another reason the ValuJet disaster occurred was mal-practice. The SabreTech workers did not properly disengage the firing pins in the oxygen tanks. They used scotch tape to secure down the pins; a very rudimentary solution for a potentially dangerous situation. In addition to this, there was no supervisor to make sure that the workers were taking the proper precautions. The same could occur in the realm of software. If a developer cuts corners with their code, things could easily run awry. The code may run, however it could be vulnerable to attacks, or crashing. If a supervisor is not there to properly look over a lazy engineer, the poorly written code could be launched and cause real-world repercussions.
	
	
Something else interesting was that the FAA did not at the time require cargo compartments to have smoke detectors. The ValuJet accident occurred after a similar accident happened in 1988. In other words, this was a problem that happened before, and the FAA didn’t change any regulations that could have possibly prevented it from happening again. The federal government has a few cybersecurity regulations in place including the HIPAA, the Gramm-Leach-Billey Act, and the 2002 Homeland Security Act. These regulations make sure that healthcare, financial, and federal organizations protect their systems. If, for example, the government did not provide a regulation, and this lead to a real world problem, they could be to blame for it. The federal government must make sure to enact regulations to keep their citizens safe. In the realm of software, this means keeping their financial, social, and personal information safe. Not only should companies pay attention to data breaches and system failures, but the government should as well. As soon as the consequences involve citizens’ safety, the government should act and impose regulations and laws to make sure that similar situations don’t happen again.
	
	
Looking at the incident from an ethical lens comes the question: who is to blame? From the actual case, the parties to blame where the following: SabreTech for not properly packaging and storing the oxygen cannisters, ValuJet for not properly supervising the SabreTech workers, and the FAA for not imposing proper safety regulations. However if a similar case happened in the software realm, I think it would be a different story. In my opinion, if a tech company were to cause an incident like this, I think the bulk of the responsibility should belong to the company. Software engineers are supposed to write durable code with all edge-cases accounted for. Not only that, but they are also expected to thoroughly test their code before launching. However, if the problem is reoccuring or involves many people’s well being, I don’t think that the government getting involved would be inappropriate. Part of the government’s job is to protect its citizens and their well being. This means making sure that the companies working within their borders are being ethical, just, and safe. If a company is allowed to make repeated mistakes without proper consequences, it will. This becomes a bigger problem, one that the government would need to handle.
