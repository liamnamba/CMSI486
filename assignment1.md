**Problems from Chapter 1:**

13. A traditional file system would be more suitable for smaller sets of data that are unrelated. It is more efficient to read and to write with a traditional file system. The file system of storage is much more arbitrary than a database, making it better for general use by most people just trying to organize their local files.

14. The columns ‘Major’, ‘Department’, ‘Course_number’, and ‘Prerequisite_number’ must be updated to hold the correct prefix change.
Instead of having each course start with the department name, you could create a coded system where each course has a unique identifier. For example the course number CS1310 could be turned into 400-1310. Where any number starting with a 4 is in the CS department. CS3320 would turn tinto 401-3320. 


**Problems from Chapter 2:**

3. The schema of the database is the overall design/structure of the database. It tells us how the data is organized and what relationships within the database are present. The state of the database is the current contents of the database at that given time.

7. There are many types of user-friendly interfaces for a database. A menu-based interface is one that presents the user with different ‘menus’ that lead the user through their request. This saves the user the trouble of remembering syntax of a query language. This would be idea for a user who is not very tech-savvy, perfect for a website or an ATM; anything that needs to be simple and easy to use. Another interface is the command line interface. This interface is simple and only contains text. The user must remember different commands to query and manipulate data. This interface would probably be used by someone familiar with the DML, and who wants a quick and direct interface to work with the data. Another interface is a form-based one. Where a user fills out a form to enter data into the system. This would be used by websites to easily collect data from their users. An example would be when doing online shopping, the websites usually require you to fill out a form of your name, address, etc. Finally, there is natural language interface. Also known as conversational interface, the system reads the user’s spoken voice to query and manipulate the database. An example of this would be the iPhone’s popular feature Siri.

14. When designing an airline reservation system, the best choice for the database would be a three-tiered architecture. We would need the three tiers: client, web-server, and database server for our system. The client would probably purchase their airline tickets by some kind of form/menu interface. But before we can accept their data and input it into the server, we must do checks and procedures. We will probably check the clients financial credentials to make sure they are valid, and be sure that the correct amount of money is transferred. There are some business specific procedures that must also be run before storing the data. An example would be that the system must be sure to reserve the seats on a specific flight so that another user could not reserve them first. 

**Questions from Chapter 3:**

2. Tuples in a relation are not ordered because relationships are meant to represent abstract and logical facts. There is no preference in relation because the definition of relation is not does not specify any order. 

5. One of the candidate keys is designated as the primary key because to make identifying tuples in relation simpler. The primary key usually has less attributes to make things less complex; it is a lot easier to identify compared to a candidate key with lots of attributes.

9. A foreign key is a key that references the primary key of another database. It could be a column or group of columns, but it provides a link between two tables. In complex databases, data must be added across multiple tables, a foreign key allows one to do this. By creating a relationship between different tables, it allows for easier data manipulation in complex systems.

13. There are a few options for the candidate key that would be plausible. If each (Univ_Section#) is unique from year to year, then that would work as a candidate key. One could also use (Room#, Building_code, Time_period, Instructor_name) assuming that no teachers are teaching in the same room at once. One could also use (Course#, Semester, Instructor_name, Time_period) assuming that a single teacher is not teaching two classes at the same time. 

20. The advantages of a surrogate key are that they are immutable, and unique. Since they are generated they can be created specifically by the programmer to make tailored specifically to a certain context. They can be made to be compatible with all systems used, and they will all be uniform. Also a surrogate key can be designed so that it is easily validated by the system. The disadvantages are that they must be generated by some algorithm. Depending on how complex the keys need to be, this algorithm can be complex, or the algorithm may run out of generateable keys. Also, since the keys are generated, they will be completely dissociated from the data in the table. This can cause problems when auditing because incorrect data will not be obvious.
